FIRST!!!!!-----

bundle install

then make schema and wireframe!


be rake db:create

be rake generate:migration
============================================================================
*in app make you necessary tables and have a small skeleton to later fill in*

create_table :name |t|

t.string :thing

end


Go to controller and make the necessary files
===========================================
users_controller.rb
cars_controller.rb


Then Models
=============
user.rb
car.rb


Then make necessary folders in views
================================
users
sessions
cars

In config folder/enviornment
=============================
add bcrypt
in gem file
add bcrypt

----

fill in files
fill in the migrations table

go to models and make associations and validations
has_many
belongs_to

Validates
=================
validates :username, presences: true
validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
validates :password, presence: true


go into console(be rake console)
check if you can get the info you need!

----

Finally make routes
===================

          get ‘/‘ do

          redirect ‘to wherever”

          or

          erb :index

          end

ask yourself do i need and index
if yes make a index route that renders you a index of all cars

do i need to let my view file access certain info?

yes so make an instance variable

          get ‘/cars’ do

          @cars = Car.all

          erb :”cars/index"

          end


____go into views and in your cars folder make a index.erb file in your cars folder
inside views make a each loop that will go through all the cars and print out name of car or whatever you need

          <%@cars.each do |car|%>

          <%= car.brand%>

          <%= car.name%>

          <%end%>



do I need to make a new car?
yes then make a route that will get you a new form

        get ‘/cars/new’ do
        erb :”cars/new"

        end


____go into views and in your cars folder make a new.erb file in your cars folder



well I’m making a new car so i have to store the data so make a post
post ‘/cars’

make a new instance

        @car = Car.new(params[:car]

        if car.save

        redirect ‘/cars’ (to see car)

        else

        @error = “couldnt make a new car please try again”

        erb :’cars/new”

        end

        end

continue to do that with the rest of the restful routes make route then view until you are done!
